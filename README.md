# Assumptions

Kept as basic as possible without spending too much effort

Data is provided in specific ordering

No specific seat plan layouts

User only able to click 1 seat at a time

Simple mount test and component render included

frontend and backend are not integrated in this app.

using json file

To allow non blocking request all requests should be async'ed using `Promise` or `Bluebird` or anything else suitable as `express` is single-threaded
